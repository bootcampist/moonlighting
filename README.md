## Description
This site utilises React with the aim of displaying a portfolio of previous projects to demonstrate my current skillset. A combination of Midjourney, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop was also employed to create the logo and images. Additionally, the form on the contact page incorporates Email.js so that when the submit button is pressed, the message and user input are sent to my email address.
